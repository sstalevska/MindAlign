This thesis presents the development and implementation of a web application in Laravel PHP, designed to revolutionize the accessibility and effectiveness of psychotherapy. The system utilizes a tailored questionnaire based on The Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP), a multidimensional measure of clients' therapy preferences. Through client responses, the application generates a Results Summary Report and provides a curated list of therapists. This thesis explores the motivation, goals, and technological aspects behind the creation of this platform, highlighting its potential to address existing challenges in the field of psychotherapy.
